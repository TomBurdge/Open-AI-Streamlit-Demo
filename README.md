### Streamlit with OpenAI

OpenAI does some amazing things in the ChatGPT front-end app, but what is the easiest way to make a front-end app that uses ChatGPT?

Enter Streamlit. Streamlit is an extremely streamlined tool for simple web apps with python.

This repo is an example app which receives a user input.

### The use case
Let's say you work at a large company and you want to know the parent brand of a company.

This can be useful for comparing my company's share to its competitors - if I work for Proctor & Gamble I don't *only* want to know my market share against Ben&Jerry's; I want to know my market share against Unilever. If we have an app which can tell us the parent brand, we can find the parent company even if our data supplier hasn't given it to us.

I have a brand, MountainDew, but what is the parent brand?

In this case, you may know the parent brand is PepsiCo.

But let's try a harder example, who is the parent brand of Chattem, Inc.

Probably only domain-specific specialists know that Chattem was acquired by Sanofi in 2009.

But OpenAI, which was effectively trained on the entire internet, does know this.
